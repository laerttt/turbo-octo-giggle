## Receipt Scanner & Analytics App

A React + Node.js application that lets users upload or scan receipt QR codes, view and categorize receipt items (powered by a LLM), manually correct categories to improve the model, and save receipts into a MySQL database. The Analytics section allows you to query your saved receipts (e.g. "How much did I spend last month?", "What was the price of coffee?").

     cp .env.template .env
     ```
   * Open `.env` and:

     1. Paste the **Get Data from Webapp** webhook URL from your n8n workflow.
     2. Paste the **Get User Question + Data** webhook URL into `server/.env` if not already there.

4. **Import n8n Workflow**

   2. In the n8n UI, import `workflow.json` from the project root.
   3. You‚Äôll see two entry points:
